The programming language used for all of the implementations in C.  Any particular language has advantages and disadvantages; we use C because it is widely available and provides the features needed for our implementation.  The programs can be translated easily to other modern programming languages, since relatively few constructs are unique to C.  We use standard C idioms when appropriate, but this book is not intended to be a reference work on C programming.  From Robert Sedgewick, Algorithms in C, third edition, Preface.
